# Pascal’s Triangle Generator
`Task Description`

The goal of this Python script is to generate Pascal’s triangle up to a specified number of rows. Pascal’s triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number represents the value of nCr (n choose r). It has the following properties:

    The first and last element of each row is always 1.
    The other elements are calculated by summing the two elements directly above them in the previous row.

`Usage`

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Open the pascal_triangle.py file.
    Modify the value of n to the desired number of rows.
    Run the script.
